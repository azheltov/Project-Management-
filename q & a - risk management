The SWOT analysis is done to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a project. This strengths and opportunities are positive risks, and the weaknesses and threats are the negative risks. By putting this into a quadrant diagram, the project team can see how strengths may offset threats, and vice versa.
Question 10:
The project team has started to identify risks on the project. What method can they best use to identify both positive and negative risks while analyzing how the strength may offset threats and vice versa?

The risk report is generally created with the risk register or after the risk register. It includes information on the sources of overall project risks and a summary of information on the identified individual project risks.
Question 11:
The project team members have finished identifying risks up to this point in the project. They have created the risk register, which lists all of the individual project risks. What should the team create next?

Once a risk has been identified, the next step is to determine how the risks will impact the project. This can be done by either doing a qualitative and/or a quantitative analysis. Sometimes, these two analyses are done sequentially, in which case a qualitative analysis is done followed by a quantitative analysis, or they can be done in parallel. Do not respond to a risk if you do not understand how the risk will impact the project.
Question 12:
The project manager has met with the legal department within the organization to be informed of a new regulation that was recently passed that may impact the project. The project manager has added this risk to the risk register. What process should the project manager do next?

It is very likely that some risks may have a high impact and a low probability, which will lead to the risk being ranked very low. An example is an earthquake in New York City. The impact may be high, but the probability of it occurring may be very low, which leads to the risk being ranked lower.
Question 13:
The project team members are reviewing the risk in the risk register to determine which risks will have the greatest impact on a project. One risk in particular has a very high impact but the team has determined that this risk should be ranked very low on the project. What statement best describes why this risk is ranked so low?

Question 14:

Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about the individual risks are accurate and reliable. If these data are not accurate then the entire assessment may be compromise and will not truly reflect the risk ranking on a project.
Question 15:
While conducting a brainstorming session with the team in order to rank the risks, the project manager is worried about the data the team is using to rank the risks. The project manager feels that some team members may only be speculating about what the probability of a risks would be. What tool can best help the project manager in this scenario?

Quantitative risk analysis is a numerical analysis of how the risk will impact the project. This is in contrast to a qualitative analysis, which would just rank the risks from the most important to the least important. The project team did not come up with a response to the flood risks in this scenario, so the choice cannot be to plan a risk response. Identify risk is used to create the risk register, and a risk report does not evaluate the risks.
Question 16:
16. The project manager and team has determined that if a flood were to take place during the building renovation project, it would delay the project by 2 weeks and cost approximately $50,000 in damages. What process did the project manager and team complete to collect these data?

Since this is a risk that will not just affect the project but the entire organization, the project team should escalate the risk toward a portfolio or the organization level. Let the organization’s legal department communicate with the project manager and determine how to respond.
Question 17:
The project team has identified, ranked, and determined how the risks will impact the project. One risk in particular is a new regulation that may pass and can have a severe effect on the project and on the entire organization. What risk response strategy would be best for the team to take?

Acceptance of an opportunity is to take no proactive action before it happens. In this scenario, the team is making no proactive response. If the permit comes earlier, the team will still start the work in the 6 weeks that it would take for the permit to come normally.
Question 18:
The project team members are coming up with ways to respond to an opportunity that they feel will not likely happen. The opportunity is that the permit for the building renovation project comes earlier than its supposed six-week wait. Since the permit office is so backed up, the project team members have decided that if the permit does come earlier than 6 weeks, they will still start the work in 6 weeks. What risk response strategy does this illustrate?

In this scenario, the project manager is implementing the risk response. The project manager is not trying to identify risks or plan a response.
Question 19:
While working on a 60-story skyscraper project, one supplier has informed the project manager that due to dangerous weather at the warehouse, the materials will be anywhere 1 to 2 months late. The project manager has already accounted for this risk and has decided to go with another supplier to get the materials. What process best illustrates this scenario?
