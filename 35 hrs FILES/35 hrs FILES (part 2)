  4 values: 
    individuals & interactions     over processes and tools
    working software               over comprehensive documentation                  (barely sufficient)

    responding to change           over following a plan
  
  12 principles:
    1. stisfy customer through early and continuous deliver of val. soft
    2. welcome changing requirements (change = competitive advantage)
    3. deliver software frequently
    4. business people and developers must work together
    5. build projects around motivated individuals
    6. the most efficient and effective method - face-to-face conversation
    7. working software = is the primary measure of progress
    8. Agile procsses promote sustainable development (constant pace)
    9. Continuous attention to technical excellence, design 
    10. Simplicity
    11. The best architectures, requirements and design emerge from self-organzing teams
    12. At regalar intervals, the team reflects on hot to become more effective then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly

AGILE STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT

            ! The first step in managing stakeholders is to identify them.
            Itâ€™s only then will the project manager be able to meet with them 
            and understand their communication requirements.
            ! Concerns about agile often include the project team being resistant to agile methods.
            
            Stakeholder engagement is one of the key success to an agile project. 
            What can the agile project manager do to keep them engaged throughout the project?
            * Short iterations and releases with the most valuable features will keep stakeholders consistently 
            involved in the project by having them in the Sprint review meeting and the release planning.
            
            What can the agile project manager use in the agile charter as a brief way to describe the goals of the project?
            * The project tweet will describe the project goal in 140 characters or less.
