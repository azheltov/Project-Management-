Question 1:
The project manager is currently estimating how much programmers will need to complete the financial software upgrade project. 
What document can the project manager use to determine who is available to work on the project?   

resource calendar?

While working on a project, the sponsor makes it clear that he does not want any of the team members to be overworked. 
This means that no team member is allowed to work overtime.
The sponsor is okay with the project being delayed due to this. 
What technique can the project manager best implement to ensure that no team member is overworked? 

(resource distribution)

*RESOURCE LEVELING - is a technique used when resources are limited or over-allocated. 
Resource leveling ensures that no resource is assigned to more than one activity at a time, ensuring that no resource is overworked.
RESOURCE SMOOTHING may accomplish the same task, but it only works if there is slack available on the activities. 
FREE FLOAT is the amount of time you can delay an activity without delaying the next activity. 
LAG is the amount of time you need to delay an activity before the next activity starts.

While working on a network upgrade project, a team member installed the network connection and is now configuring the router 
in order to work with the network connection. 
The network connection must be done before the router can be configured. This is an example of what kind of dependency?  

(dependencies)

*MANDATORY dependency is when activities must be done in a certain order. For example, you must complete A then complete B. 
INTERNAL dependencies are things that are under the control of the project team, 
and EXTERNAL dependencies are things that are outside the control of the project team, such as getting a permit. 
DISCRETIONARY dependency is when two activities can be done in any order and they’re not dependent upon each other.

The project team is having a very difficult time deciding what method they should use when programming the new functions in the application. 
They can choose between four different methods, and the team is evenly split regarding which method to choose. The project manager has decided 
that he will choose the method for them and will take the responsibility in case it is not the best way to program functions. 
What best describes this technique?   

*In AUTOCRATIC decision making, an individual makes the decision for the team and takes responsibility for the decision. 
VOTING is when the team votes on a potential decision, 
and MULTI-criteria decision is when they use a different criteria are used to evaluate a decision. 
Leadership refers to skills for managing the team.

The project team has just started to code the redesigned accounting application when a key stakeholder asks for the application
in order to include a very specific report to the company’s expenses. The stakeholder has submitted a change request to the project manager. 
What would be the most important input to consider for this change request?   

Explanation
Work performance reports is an input to the process of performing integrated change control, 
as it will show the overall status of the project. The other choices are not inputs to this process.
===

While working on an agile project, a customer has requested for the team to deploy the software as soon as the iteration is done. 
The customer has already checked the completed part of the software and has accepted it. The team has refused to deploy the software. What work best explains the team’s refusal?   


Explanation
Iterations are part of a product that is inspected by the customers. An iteration may not be something that can be released to users since 
it only represents a few weeks’ worth of work. A release usually includes multiple iterations that are releasable to the customers. 
In this question the customer has already accepted the iteration, which means there are no errors in it.

===
While conducting procurement on a project, the project manager has received many different bids with a wide variance of estimated cost for the work. 
What can the project manager use to best determine which vendor has given a realistic price?     


Explanation
An independent estimate is usually done by an outside entity to help give the project manager a more independent understanding 
of what certain project work will cost. Inspections and audits are done after the seller is selected to ensure the work stays on contract. 
Screening and weighing systems are done to help select sellers.

As the project team is collecting the new project’s requirements, the organization’s legal department has 
informed them of a new law that could affect the project. 
The team determines that it is mandatory to implement this new law in the project. What is this called? 

Good job!
A regulation is an official guideline that must be followed by the project, usually imposed by local or national law. 
A standard is a guideline that should be followed, but is not mandatory. 
A baseline is used to measure the performance of the project, such as cost, schedule, and scope. 
A system is a set of processes and procedures that a 
company will implement to manage something, such as accounting procedures to invoice customers.

Peter is working on a project that he knows little about. He was assigned by the project management office (PMO) 
and they have almost complete control over the project. 
What type of PMO best describes this scenario?  

success alert
Good job!
In a directive PMO, the office takes control of the project by managing the projects and assigning the project manager. 
Controlling PMOs control the way the project is done by providing templates and frameworks. 
Supportive PMOs have a low degree of control on the project. “Guiding” is not a type of PMO.

===
Question 4:
Mary’s new project staff are some of the best talents in the company. The team members will use their own methodologies and prefer to be 
in control of the project; they would only like to be provided templates and lessons learned  from other projects. 
What type of PMO would be best for this project? 

success alert
Good job!
Since the team will be mostly in control and just needs templates, the best fit would be “supportive.” 
In a directive PMO, the office takes control of the project by managing projects and assigning the project manager. 
Controlling PMOs control the way the project is done by providing methodologies or frameworks. 
“Managing” is not a type of PMO.

Question 5:
Pat is working in an organization where she does project management full time. However, she still needs to consults with functional managers 
in order to acquire her project team. What organizational structure type best describes this situation?  

success alert
Good job!
In a strong matrix, the project manager is full time and has a moderate to high control over resources. In a weak or functional matrix, project management is part-time. In a project-oriented organization, 
the project manager has high to complete control over resources.
===
Question 6:
Ian has been working on an office remodel project for close to 6 months. 
He feels like the project is going poorly due to a lack of resources from the functional managers and his lack of time to work on the project. 
Ian spends most of him day doing operational work. What organizational structure best describes this?   

Good job!
In a weak matrix, project management is part-time and resource availability is controlled by the functional manager. 
All other choices require a full-time project manager.
===
Question 7:
ABX Shipping is a large global company with many departments, some of which are have part-time project management and others, such as research and development, where it is full time. Where the project managers work determines their control over resources. 
What organizational structure best describes this organization?

Project-oriented requires project managers to be full time and have control over resources.
===
Question 8:
Mark has just started a new job as a project coordinator for a company. 
He will be working with a group to develop their new website. Mark finds working on this project to be difficult due to always needing the company owner’s approval for budget matters. He also has very few resources to work with because the company is very small. 
What organizational structure best describes this scenario?   

success alert
Good job!
In an organic or simple structure, the owner controls the budget, and there are few to no resources. Answers B and C are not organizational structure types. 
A weak matrix would have a functional manager to control the budget.
===
Question 9:
Mark has just started working for a company that has little to no project management framework or functions. 
He notices that most people manage projects on their own with no oversight or established processes. 
Mark has spoken the CEO and they have decided to change this. What is this organization lacking?

Good job!
Project governance refers to the framework, functions, and processes that guide a company to create a project. The other choices are made up.

===
Question 10:
Project management and operations management are sometimes managed by the same set of people. 
What is one of the key differences between project and operations management? 

success alert
Good job!
Project management is a temporary endeavor, while operations management is ongoing and never stops. 
A project manager does not necessarily need to be certified.
===

Mark has gotten a new job at a company that is about to create a new product. This new product will be a very complex software that may take years to
create and have many different groups of people.

She meets with the organization’s senior management, and they have not determined if the project should continue or not, 
as the current deliverable may be all they need. What would best describe this review?   

Good job!
A phase gate is done at the end of a phase, deciding whether to continue to the next phase or not. 
A kickoff meeting is generally done at the end of planning and sometimes at the end of the project’s initiated sections in order to start the next section. 
Answers C and D do not exist.
===

Question 14:
What best describes an area of project management where the project manager will work with the project team in order to complete the project work?   

success alert
Good job!
“Executing” is the process group where the project manager acquires both the physical and human resources to complete the project work. The main output of execution is the project deliverables (work). “Initiating” is used to authorize the project, and “planning” is used to determine the course of action needed to build the deliverables. 
“Closing” is used to review the project and transition the deliverables to the customer or sponsor.
===

Question 15:
Project manager Bill has started planning his project and will gather all requirements from his customers, 
then build the project deliverable in its entirety. Bill will generally not get any input from the customer while the product is being made, 
and the customer will only review it at the end. What life cycle best describes Bill’s project?     

success alert
Good job!
A predictive life cycle is when the project scope is known early in the project. For Bill to create the deliverable in its entirety 
without any feedback from the customer, he will have gathered the scope in its entirety before executing the project. 
All other choices are adaptive and used in projects when the deliverable is built in increments, with continuous customer feedback.
===
Question 16:
Mary has just been awarded a new product development project. After speaking with some of the customers, it seems that they do not know how they would 
like the product to look and feel. 
They would like to be more involved in the product development and give Mary continuous feedback. What project life cycle would best fit this project?  

Good job!
In an incremental life cycle, the deliverable is built in a series of iterations with continuous feedback from project stakeholders. 
“Predictive” or “waterfall” are the same thing, and are only used when the scope is known early in the project. 
“Non-predictive” does not exist.
===

Question 17:
One phase of the project has been completed, and the stakeholders are very happy with the transition of the project deliverable. 
What would be the next best step on this project?   

success alert
Good job!
When a project is completed, the project stakeholders should conduct a phase gate or phase review to determine whether to continue the project or end it. 
You should not start a phase if you have not reviewed the previously finished phase. 
Archive project records would have been done in the phase that was just completed. 
A kickoff meeting is used at the end of the planning or initiating a section of the project in order to start the next section.

===
===
Question 1:
A project manager is about to start planning a new sales software development project and will work with the project team to create a project management plan. What will the project manager and the team not use in planning a project?  

ood job!
Work performance information is an output of monitoring and controlling and is not used during planning. The scope statement, scope baseline, and risk register are all created during the planning processes.
===
Question 2:
The project manager has received a change request from the project sponsor to reduce the budget by 20%. After the project manager has reviewed the change, he decides that the only way this can be done is by removing a part of the project that is not yet completed. Who should approve this change?  

Good job!

===
Question 3:
The CEO of a small business has requested that the company’s accounting software be upgraded to better support their financial records. He has requested that the software include a report that can forecast the following month’s expenses. Where would be the best place the CEO can outline why this project needs to get done?   

success alert
Good job!
The business documents contain two parts: the business case and the benefits management plan. In this question, the business case would be used to explain why the project would need to get done. The “scope outline” is a made-up term. The scope statement and WBS shows the work needed to finish the project.
===
Question 4:
Project manager Mike worked with the sponsor, Chris, to get the project charter approved for the new office reorganizing project. While reviewing the requirements, both Mike and Chris are sure that there is no need to upgrade the office’s current wireless network. Where is the best place for Mike and Chis to store this information?   

success alert
Good job!
Mike and Chris are making an assumption, as they are sure of their determination but don’t know it for a fact; an assumption log is used to track all assumptions made throughout the project. A project charter and business case have nothing to do with assumptions. “Assumption documentation” is a made-up term.
===
Question 5:
While working on creating a project management plan, the project manager has brought a group of expert programmers and a planner to ensure it is created correctly. What tool best describes this approach?   

The tool that is being used is a focus group, which is part of data gathering. “Meeting” and “interpersonal and team skills” do not involve a focus group. Data analysis is used to analyze data that has already been gathered.
===
Question 6:
When a project has been executed, what input would best help the project manager determine how to manage changes to the project?  

Good job!
The project management plan contains the change management plan. The change control board is a too “Change control plan” and “change control charts” are made-up terms.
===
Question 7:
Company XYZ has been executing a new business development project for the last 4 months. A few stakeholders have requested changes to the scope and have gotten them approved. When a change is approved, what is the next best step to conduct on a project?  

success alert
Good job!

Approved change request is not an input into the processes of monitor and control project work, validate scope, and close project or phase.
===
Question 8:
A change control board has informed the project manager that a change request made by stakeholder Mark to reduce the project schedule by 2 weeks was rejected. What is the first step the project manager should take?  

success alert
Good job!
Once a change has been approved or rejected the project manager should update the change log to reflect the status of the change. Asking Mark to reduce his change request by 1 week would need a new change request. The change was already rejected, there is no need to get the team involved. Resubmitting the change request, without any new changes would result in the same outcome.
===
Question 9:
The deliverable for the product improvement project has been accepted by the sponsor. What should the project manager do next?   

success alert
Good job!
Once a deliverable has been accepted, the project manager should then conduct the close project or phase process. In that process the project manager will discuss the lessons learned and release or reassign the project team. A project manager should never leave a project without formally closing it.
===
Question 10:
Project team member Josh has learned a new method to program the financial application by reading a book about functions in applications. What kind of knowledge is this?   

success alert
Good job!

“Tacit” is generally from beliefs, insights, and experiences. 
“Common” and “programming” are not types of knowledge.
===
Question 11:
While executing a project, the project manager has learned that an IT vendor will delay the delivery of the server needed to implement the phone system. This problem will need to be resolved soon. What should the PM do first?  

success alert
Good job!

===
Question 12:
The project team is currently working on the office move project, and they have completed moving one of the floors to the other building. While the work is progressing, what document would be best for the project manager to update?   

success alert
Good job!
. The work performance data will describe what is happening to the deliverable as it is being done. The issue log is only updated when there are issues on the project. Change logs are only updated once a change request is filed. “Work logs” is a made-up term.
===
Question 13:
The project sponsor has been asking the project manager to close the project as soon as possible, since the deliverable has been created. The project manager has informed the sponsor that the project cannot close yet. What best explains why the project manager cannot close the project?   

success alert
Good job!
In order for the project or phase to be closed, the deliverable has to be accepted. An accepted deliverable is a key input to the process of close project or phase. You will release the project team during the close project or phase. If the deliverable was defective, then it would not be considered done.
===
Question 14:
A company has plans to improve one their products. They have started to work with Mary to get this project authorized by the board of directors. What is the output of this process?   

success alert
Good job!

===
Question 16:
A project team has just completed a major module in a new application. They were able to complete it in about half the time that was approved for them using a new method from a recent programmers’ publication. What should the project manager do first with this new programming method?  

Good job!
Once new knowledge has been acquired, the project manager should update the lesson learned register. This will ensure that the knowledge is saved and can be used throughout the project, as well as on future projects. Updating the plan or sponsor will not update the lesson learned register or document the method. You cannot close a project or phase if it had not been completed and accepted.
===

Question 17:
While executing a large project for building a bridge, the PM has received a request that would affect the structure of the bridge and may need it to be completely redesigned. The change came from the local transportation department. What should the PM do next?   

success alert
Good job!
The first step would be to assess the changes and understand how it would affect the project, which may lead to stopping the work and redesigning the bridge. You should never stop work on a project without first understanding the impact of a change on a project. Never take action without first reviewing and assessing your information.
===
Question 18:
A phase of a long software development project has been completed. The phase was considered very successful: the team was able to complete the deliverables in about half the time and under budget. The deliverables were successfully transferred to the next phase of the project. What should the project manager do next for this phase?  


===
Question 19:
While monitoring and controlling the project, the project manager notices that the project has been behind schedule for 2 out of the 3 weeks. The PM thinks it will also be behind schedule this week. What kind of data analysis is this?   

success alert
Good job!
Trend analysis is used to analyze when a trend might be forming and where it’s going. Variance analysis is only used to find a variance, not to predict it. “Prediction analysis” is made up, and expert judgement is not part of data analysis.
