Question 1:
The project manager is currently estimating how much programmers will need to complete the financial software upgrade project. 
What document can the project manager use to determine who is available to work on the project?   

resource calendar?

While working on a project, the sponsor makes it clear that he does not want any of the team members to be overworked. 
This means that no team member is allowed to work overtime.
The sponsor is okay with the project being delayed due to this. 
What technique can the project manager best implement to ensure that no team member is overworked? 

(resource distribution)

*RESOURCE LEVELING - is a technique used when resources are limited or over-allocated. 
Resource leveling ensures that no resource is assigned to more than one activity at a time, ensuring that no resource is overworked.
RESOURCE SMOOTHING may accomplish the same task, but it only works if there is slack available on the activities. 
FREE FLOAT is the amount of time you can delay an activity without delaying the next activity. 
LAG is the amount of time you need to delay an activity before the next activity starts.

While working on a network upgrade project, a team member installed the network connection and is now configuring the router 
in order to work with the network connection. 
The network connection must be done before the router can be configured. This is an example of what kind of dependency?  

(dependencies)

*MANDATORY dependency is when activities must be done in a certain order. For example, you must complete A then complete B. 
INTERNAL dependencies are things that are under the control of the project team, 
and EXTERNAL dependencies are things that are outside the control of the project team, such as getting a permit. 
DISCRETIONARY dependency is when two activities can be done in any order and they’re not dependent upon each other.

While working on an agile project, a customer has requested for the team to deploy the software as soon as the iteration is done. 
The customer has already checked the completed part of the software and has accepted it. The team has refused to deploy the software. What work best explains the team’s refusal?   


Explanation
Iterations are part of a product that is inspected by the customers. An iteration may not be something that can be released to users since 
it only represents a few weeks’ worth of work. A release usually includes multiple iterations that are releasable to the customers. 
In this question the customer has already accepted the iteration, which means there are no errors in it.

===
While conducting procurement on a project, the project manager has received many different bids with a wide variance of estimated cost for the work. 
What can the project manager use to best determine which vendor has given a realistic price?

An independent estimate is usually done by an outside entity to help give the project manager a more independent understanding 
of what certain project work will cost. Inspections and audits are done after the seller is selected to ensure the work stays on contract. 
Screening and weighing systems are done to help select sellers.

===

Question 14:
What best describes an area of project management where the project manager will work with the project team in order to complete the project work?   

success alert
Good job!
“Executing” is the process group where the project manager acquires both the physical and human resources to complete the project work. The main output of execution is the project deliverables (work). “Initiating” is used to authorize the project, and “planning” is used to determine the course of action needed to build the deliverables. 
“Closing” is used to review the project and transition the deliverables to the customer or sponsor.
===

Question 15:
Project manager Bill has started planning his project and will gather all requirements from his customers, 
then build the project deliverable in its entirety. Bill will generally not get any input from the customer while the product is being made, 
and the customer will only review it at the end. What life cycle best describes Bill’s project?     

success alert
Good job!
A predictive life cycle is when the project scope is known early in the project. For Bill to create the deliverable in its entirety 
without any feedback from the customer, he will have gathered the scope in its entirety before executing the project. 
All other choices are adaptive and used in projects when the deliverable is built in increments, with continuous customer feedback.
===
Question 16:
Mary has just been awarded a new product development project. After speaking with some of the customers, it seems that they do not know how they would 
like the product to look and feel. 
They would like to be more involved in the product development and give Mary continuous feedback. What project life cycle would best fit this project?  

Good job!
In an incremental life cycle, the deliverable is built in a series of iterations with continuous feedback from project stakeholders. 
“Predictive” or “waterfall” are the same thing, and are only used when the scope is known early in the project. 
“Non-predictive” does not exist.
===

Question 17:
One phase of the project has been completed, and the stakeholders are very happy with the transition of the project deliverable. 
What would be the next best step on this project?   

success alert
Good job!
When a project is completed, the project stakeholders should conduct a phase gate or phase review to determine whether to continue the project or end it. 
You should not start a phase if you have not reviewed the previously finished phase. 
Archive project records would have been done in the phase that was just completed. 
A kickoff meeting is used at the end of the planning or initiating a section of the project in order to start the next section.
